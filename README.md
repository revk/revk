# RevK

I write code for a living, but only when it is fun.
Geek, techie, pedant, cycle, walk, run an ISP.
I even design router/firewalls from scratch.
Canon over Nikon, Picard over Kirk. Stargate fan.
Yes that picture is me, in a Panama hat, on the Panama canal.

I use a lot of open source, and so does my company, so this is a chance for me to give something back.

There are all sorts of libraries and tools here, from making QR codes, to constructing CO2 monitors from an ESP32.

Most of this software and circuit designs is provided free by Andrews & Arnold Ltd, my company.
