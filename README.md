I write code for a living.
Geek, techie, pedant, cycle, walk, run an ISP.
I even design router/firewalls from scratch.
Canon over Nikon, Picard over Kirk. Stargate fan.

I use a lot of open source, and so does my company, so this is a chance for me to give something back.

There are all sorts of libraries and tools here, from making QR codes, to constructing CO2 monitors from an ESP32.
